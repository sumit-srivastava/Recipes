Managing the Broker
===================
To stop the server or check its status, etc., you can invoke rabbitmqctl (as an administrator)

==> Invoke rabbitmqctl stop to stop the server.
==> Invoke rabbitmqctl status to check whether it is running.

Examples:
1. sudo rabbitmqctl status
2. sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues
3. sudo service rabbitmq-server restart


Logging
=======

API Details
===========
Checking whether a queue already exists
-----------------------------------------
a. channel.queueDeclare()
b. channel.queueDeclarePassive()

The behavior of the two methods is the same
in case the queue already exists; but in case it doesn't, the first one will silently create it and
return back (that's actually the most frequently used case), the latter will raise an exception.
